# sol-proj


Project idea: "Decentralized Guestbook"
Concept: A webpage where any user can connect their Solana wallet (for example, Phantom) and leave a short message. All messages are stored forever on the Solana blockchain and are visible to everyone.

Technical stack (What we need):
Smart contract (Program):
Rust. This is the standard for writing Solana programs.
Framework: Anchor. This is an extremely popular framework that greatly simplifies the development, testing, and interaction with Solana programs. I highly recommend starting with it.
Frontend (web interface):
Framework: React or Next.js.
Language: TypeScript (for better typing and working with libraries).
Libraries for interaction with the blockchain: @solana/web3.js and @coral-xyz/anchor.
Wallet: Phantom or Solflare for testing in the browser.
